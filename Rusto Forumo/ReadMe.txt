Purpose was to create a blog/forum in Rust along with getting a better understanding on the functionality of Rust.

Sources used in this project:
1) https://notryanb.github.io/rust-blog-series-1.html
2) https://notryanb.github.io/rust-blog-series-2.html
3) https://github.com/notryanb/rust-blog-demo

Notes:
1) & 2) were used to understand and build the base of the project in rust. 
3) was used as a template and base to work through since 1) & 2) were severly outdated with how fast rust and diesel updates.

This project was heavily influenced by the structure of these sources.
